<h1>Simple Email Form</h1>
<p>A very bare bones, simple email contact form. Just put the form in your page, change the action email to the mail you would like to receive the information to and enjoy!</p>

<h2>Setup:</h2>
<p>
  Setting up this system is rather simple, just put the form on your website, and change the email in the forms action to the one where you would like to receive the emails.
</p>

<p>
  Now start up a local server or publish your code to your host and try it out, the first test will send you a confirmation mail, and after confirming the activities, you are ready to go!
